The codes here show the workflow set up by Virginia Tech Data Repository (https://data.lib.vt.edu/) to download and deposit bags to aptrust via DART (https://aptrust.github.io/dart-docs/users/workflows/). Virginia Tech Data Services uses  a simple client for the figshare API in python from Cognoma: https://github.com/cognoma/figshare, parts of LD-Cool-P from University of Arizona workflow: https://github.com/padmacarstens/LD-Cool-P to download files and retrieve files from the Virginia Tech Data Repository: VTDR (https://data.lib.vt.edu). VTDR runs on the figshare for institutions platform.
The codes are run to create folders to save the downloaded private files (to ingest bags)/ published files (to publication bags) to the local computer/remote storage, create an Archival Package readme file for archival purposes in addition to an automated README file in rtf format created from the filled in figshare metadata fields.
Lastly, the codes deposit these bags to APTrust via their DART platform (https://aptrust.github.io/dart-docs/users/workflows/) and/or Virginia Tech Libraries storage 

Documentation on how to set up a Windows environment to use these codes is available at CuratorWorkflowDiagramWithScriptExecution_v1_20220819.pdf
